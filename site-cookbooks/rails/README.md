Description
===========

This cookbook will deploy gitlab in a development environment. (using Vagrant)

It was heavily (if not entirely) inspired by atomic-penguin's work, who is
maintaining a solution to deploy Gitlab in a production environment.  (you can
    find it on github
    [here](https://github.com/atomic-penguin/cookbook-gitlab))
